Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Department of Psychology at Swansea University. My current work involves the application of novel analysis approaches to large online gambling datasets for a project funded by the ICRG. My primary interest is in computational modelling of psychological behaviours, particularly with choice-response time models, but with a developing interest in reinforcement learning approaches. I completed my PhD in Psychology at Swansea University in 2018, then spent a few years conducting research at the Department of Psychiatry in Cambridge University before returning to Swansea for my current research position.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in International Studies Quarterly, Conflict Management and Peace Science, Political Science Research and Methods, and PS: Political Science & Politics, among other outlets. My research explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of institutions in international relations. I have teaching experience in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified instructor with The Carpentries.
